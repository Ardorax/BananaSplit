## Scripts to generate coding style reports

The script display a colored output on the terminal (inspired by [Abricot-Norminette](https://github.com/Just1truc/Abricot-Norminette)).

### Linux

Requirement :
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed 

Use `coding-style.sh`

By default the script doesn't update the docker. Be sure to check for update
every time before the end of a project with the argument `-u`.

This script is delivered "as is" without any warranty.

A part of the source code comes from [Epitech](https://github.com/Epitech).
